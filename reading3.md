# Git Intro #

1. ***Version Control*** is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file

2. ***Centralized Version Control System*** allows for collaboration on files within a team

3. ***Distributed Version Control systems*** allows clients to create multiple mirrored repositories, important for when CVS goes down

## **What is Git?** ##

-*Snapshots*: Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots

-*Local Operations*: Git relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources

-*Tracking Changes*: Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git

## **acp** ##

-*a*: git add FILE NAME. This adds the files to be tracked and prepare to be commited

-*c*: git commit -m "Changes made". This step commits the chnages you made to the file

-*p*: git push origin main. This step pushes the changes made from your local repository to a remote repository
