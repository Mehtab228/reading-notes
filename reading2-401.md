# Java Basics

## It's important to know about loops so we can perform operations on data-types such as arrays. As well as what functions we can use on arrays

### *Which loops use a loop counter?*

- A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter

### *Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays*

- arraycopy method of the System class instead of manually iterating through the elements of the source array and placing each one into the destination array

- Comparing two arrays to determine if they are equal or not (the equals method)

- Filling an array to place a specific value at each index (the fill method)

### *Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples*

- A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories
