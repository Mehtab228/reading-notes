## Adding images to a webpage can help engage a user more and have them spend more time on you page. Also adding color makes it more appealing, leading to a better overall user experience ###

### *What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?* ###

- Alt text is what the page reads when someone googles something similar to your alt description your page is what will pop up. It can help you get more visits

### *How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?* ###

- Captions benefit even people who can see the image, whereas alt text provides the same functionality as an absent image. Therefore, captions and alt text shouldn't just say the same thing, because they both appear when the image is gone.

### *Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document* ###

- A better solution, is to use the HTML <figure> and <figcaption> elements. These are created for exactly this purpose: to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption. Our above example could be rewritten like this:

### *Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community* ###

- SVG is an XML-based vector graphics format that specifies the contents of an image as a set of drawing commands that create shapes, lines, apply colors, filters, and so forth. SVG files are ideal for diagrams, icons, and other images which can be accurately drawn at any size. As such, SVG is popular for user interface elements in modern Web design.

-Good choice for simple images and animations. Prefer PNG for lossless and indexed still images, and consider WebP, AVIF or APNG for animation sequences.

### *What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?* ###

- Unless you're willing to compromise on quality, you should use a lossless format for screenshots. This is particularly important if there's any text in your screenshot, as text easily becomes fuzzy and unclear under lossy compression.

- PNG is probably your best bet, but lossless WebP is arguably going to be better compressed

### *Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge* ###

- Foreground colors are superimposed on top of the background color, in this case you would see the foreground color and not the background color

### *Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?* ###

- I would first select the element he would like to add color to and ask him if he wants the text to have color or the background. Based on his response I would add color to his choice

### *What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?* ###

- You should consider what you want to draw the visitor to. The most important elements should have characteristics that draw your attention.

### *What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?* ###

-Font size changes the size of the text. Font weight determines the thickness of the characters that make up the text. Font style changes the style of the font to something different than the standard

### *Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element* ###

- You could add margins or you could alter the padding to move it away from other elements
