# Emotional Eq #

## It is important to have emotional intelligence because it allows for safe and comfortable interactions with individuals in a team. It allows you to be aware of cues that people may be uncomfortable or need some support even if they may not be able to vocalize it ##

### *Emotinal Intelligence* ###

- One thing I've improved in with my emotional EQ is being able to reflec and decide whether I want to act when I feel a strong impulse to do something

### *Biases* ###

- I've become more aware of the fact that even if I have different opinions than an individual it doesn't mean I can't get along with them. Their entire personality doesn't boil down to a few opinions and judging them for that is selling myself short
