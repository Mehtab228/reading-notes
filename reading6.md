# JS Intro #

- (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language

-Functions that are part of objects are called methods

-Return values are just what they sound like â€” the values that a function returns when it has completed

-To return a value from a custom function, you need to use the return keyword

-JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type

-A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)

-A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function

-Closures are useful because they let you associate data (the lexical environment) with a function that operates on that data

-Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on the web. Much of the code written in front-end JavaScript is event-based
