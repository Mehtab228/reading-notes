## How Do I Define a Growth Mindset? ##
- A growth minset is the belief that when faced with failure, rather than give up an individual uses failure as a tool to improve their understanding. It is the belief that through hard work and persevierence even the most daunting tasks can be made manageable. Inteligence is not a static trait, but one that can be improved upon through hard work. 



## What are Three things I need to remember for a growth mindset? ##
1. Look at challanges and failures as opportunities to grow
2. Hit the **I Believe** button when you begin to doubt yourself
3. Don't be stubborn ask for help when you need it

# A Little Bit About Myself! #
- My name is Mehtab Riar and I am 27 years old. I have spent a large portion of my professional career working within microbiology and immunology, which helped cultivate my appreciation for the sciences as well as how information is communicated. One of the reasons I want to become a developer is to help *bridge the gap* between the general public and the scientific community, I believe the lack of easy to access information can sow distrust in what is a life saving institution.

- I am incredibly passionate about is traveling, getting to experience and learn about different cultures can be very rewarding.

- One of my favourite pastimes when in Seattle is visiting the Chihuly Garden and Glass!
