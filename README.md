# A Little Bit About Myself #

- My name is Mehtab Riar and I am 27 years old. I have spent a large portion of my professional career working within microbiology and immunology, which helped cultivate my appreciation for the sciences as well as how information is communicated. One of the reasons I want to become a developer is to help *bridge the gap* between the general public and the scientific community, I believe the lack of easy to access information can sow distrust in what is a life saving institution.

- I am incredibly passionate about traveling, getting to experience and learn about different cultures can be very rewarding.

- One of my favourite pastimes when in Seattle is visiting the Chihuly Garden and Glass!
