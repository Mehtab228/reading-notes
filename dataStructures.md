# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures and Algorithms (often referred to as DSA) are fundamental principles in computer science. They are the bedrock of what we will be doing and how to solve more complex higher level problems

### *What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?*

- One of the most important things when deciding what data structure to use is taking into consideration what operations you plan on implementing. It's important to limit Big-O

### *How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?*

- To prevent infinite recursion, you need at least one branch (i.e. of an if/else statement) that does not make a recursive call. Branches without recursive calls are called base cases; branches with recursive calls are called recursive cases. Functions can also be mutually recursive
