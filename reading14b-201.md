## My Takeaway ##

- Working in groups has shown increased productivity, faster innovation rates, achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction

- the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs

- No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel psychologically safe

- We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We canâ€™t be focused just on efficiency

- However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement

- My overall takeawy is the importance of trust and comfort within a team. New innovative ideas won't be discussed if memebers of the team feel uncomfortable sharing their opinions and ideas
