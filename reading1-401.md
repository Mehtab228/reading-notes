# Java Basics #

## Understanding how java is written and how its compiled is important in learning how it works and how to write it. It has its own set of rules and its important to become familiar with its syntax as well as its data types ##

### *What does “strong typed” mean?* ###

- In computer programming, a programming language is strongly typed if it demands the specification of data types. A programming language is loosely typed, or weakly typed, when it does not require the explicit specification of different types of objects and variables

### *Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript* ###

- When you compile code, the compilor (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand (i.e. converts from Java to machine language)
