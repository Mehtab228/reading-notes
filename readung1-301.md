# Introduction to React and Components #

## Figuring out ways to make our code cleaner and easier to read is an important part of coding. However, before we can learn how to do that its important build the foundation by going over concepts like components before we jump into rreact to understand exactly what is happening ##

### What is a “component”? ###

- A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

- A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture

### What are the characteristics of a component? ###

- A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.
