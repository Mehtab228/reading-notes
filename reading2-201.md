## Understanding the differences between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is important when designing our application. It is important to understand what each language is capable of and when we would use what feature ##

1. *Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?*

-We need to make sure we are using the correct elements, giving our content the correct meaning, function, or appearance. In this context, the h1 element is also a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page" It will automatically apply certain features such as making the h1 text appear larger

2. *How many levels of headings are there in HTML?*

-There are a total of 6 heading elements, each element represents a different level of content in the document; <h1> represents the main heading, <h2> represents subheadings, <h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on

3. *What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?*

-You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning. The <sup> and <sub> elements handle this job. For example:

<p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
<p>Caffeine's chemical formula is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.</p>

results in: 

My birthday is on the 25th of May 2001.

Caffeine's chemical formula is C8H10N4O2.

If x2 is 9, x must equal 3 or -3
