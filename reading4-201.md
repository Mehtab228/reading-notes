## This topic is important because it allows to link sources to pages outside of our webpage which could prove to have a lot of utility. Positioning in CSS is incredibly important specially when trying to place everything according to your wireframe. Using reusable blocks of code will result in dryer easier to read code. ##

### *To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element* ###

- You have to place it within an < a > element

### *The href attribute contains what information?* ###

- The href attribute contains the link for the source you are trying to add

### *What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?* ###

- You could put the link in plain text

### *What is meant by “normal flow”?* ###

- Elements on a webpage lay out in normal flow if you haven't applied any CSS to change the way they behave. And, as we began to discover, you can change how elements behave either by adjusting their position in normal flow or by removing them from it altogether

### *What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?* ###

- By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content

### *___ positioning is the default for every html element.* ###

- normal flow 

### *Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element* ###

- An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on

### *What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?* ###

- This works in exactly the same way as absolute positioning, with one key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport

### *Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation* ###

- Declaring a function just defines it and fills it with the information you want. Invoking a function actually allows the function to run.

### *What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?* ###

- Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them — these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly.
