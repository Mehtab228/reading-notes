# Engineering Readings

## This topic is important because it's important to know what you bring to the table in a new career. As well as how to aproach and solve problems

### *What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?*

- I believe my history in research gives me a unique perspective in problem solving and one that I can bring to whatever job I end up in.

### *What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?*

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong

- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective

- Research: google the problem/read documentation, odds are you aren't the first person to have this problem
