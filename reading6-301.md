## - ##

### *What is node.js?* ###

- Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library

### *In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?* ###

- The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute

### *What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?* ###

- This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine)

### *What is npm?* ###

- a package manager that comes bundled with Node

### *What version of node are you running on your machine?* ###

- 18.9

### *What version of npm are you running on your machine?* ###

- 8.19.1

### *What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?* ###

- npm install -g jshint

### *What is node used for?* ###

- Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications

### *What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?* ###

- Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
- Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea
- Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey
- Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful, well structured solution
- Efficiency: it is easier to catch mistakes in the making
- Engaged collaboration: the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone

### *In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?* ###

- Getting the chance to actively used vocab assosiated with coding helps cement some concepts

### *How does pair programming work?* ###

- One person is the navigator and one is the driver. The navigator tells the driver what code to write and about halfway through they switch
